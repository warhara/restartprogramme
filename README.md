# AWS ReStartProgramme
AWS re/Start is a free, cohort-based training program designed to help individuals launch a new career in the cloud. The program is open to anyone, regardless of their technology background, and focuses on providing technical skills training and professional development support to unemployed or underemployed individuals, particularly those who are underrepresented or marginalized in the workforce.

Through a combination of coursework and hands-on labs, learners will gain the technical skills needed for entry to mid-level cloud roles, using real-world scenarios to prepare them for success in the industry. In addition to technical training, the program also provides professional skills development, such as resume and interview coaching, to help learners prepare for job interviews and meet with potential employers. Collaborating organizations involved in AWS re/Start support a wide range of individuals, including minorities, young people, and those who have been displaced from their jobs.
